# Zero-Gravity: The Bridgeless Solvency Loop 🪐🚀

**Zero-Gravity** is a next-generation payment protocol designed to rotate liquidity from Layer 2 ecosystems (Starknet) directly into real-world utility on **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**—without the risks of traditional cross-chain bridges.

## 🚀 The Problem
Cross-chain UX is broken. Traditional bridges are slow, require complex manual steps, and are notorious for being the most vulnerable point in DeFi (*Bridge-Risk*). Users on modern L2s like Starknet have no easy way to use their assets for real-life retail payments.

## 🪐 The Solution: The Solvency Loop
Zero-Gravity introduces a "Bridgeless" architecture that leverages the unique strengths of two chains:
1. **AI Intent Parsing:** Powered by **Google Gemini 3 Flash**, the UI understands natural language (e.g., *"Pay $0.50 for coffee"*) and handles all the cryptographic complexity in the background.
2. **Starknet Validium Vault:** Assets are locked on Starknet using a secure vault contract, ensuring verifiable solvency.
3. **Shadow Protocol Oracle:** A custom high-speed oracle attests to the L2 state and triggers an instant **0-conf settlement on Bitcoin Cash**.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Zero-Bridge-Risk:** No assets are ever "wrapped" or stored in a vulnerable multi-sig bridge.
- **Sub-25s Settlement:** Achieve retail-speed payments using BCH's superior 0-confirmation capabilities.
- **Intent-Based UX:** A sleek, "Command-Line" style interface that makes crypto payments feel like Web2.
- **Auditability:** Every transaction leaves a cryptographic audit trail on the BCH blockchain via `OP_RETURN`.

## 🧬 Technical Stack
- **L2:** Starknet (Cairo Contracts)
- **L1:** Bitcoin Cash (CashScript Covenants)
- **AI:** Google Gemini 3 Flash (Intent Orchestration)
- **Backend:** Node.js Oracle + Supabase Realtime
- **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind CSS (Premium Dark Mode UI)

### **Track**
> **Applications Track**

### **Need teammates?**
> **Yes** (I am looking for a CMO/Marketing partner).

### **What is your vision for this project?**
> To build the "Bridgeless Solvency Loop" where liquidity from any high-security Layer 2 (like Starknet) can be spent instantly in the real world using Bitcoin Cash's 0-conf technology, all orchestrated by natural language AI.

### **What problem does this product solve?**
> It eliminates "Bridge-Risk" and cross-chain latency. Traditional bridges are vulnerable honey pots. Zero-Gravity uses verifiable L2 vaults and instant BCH settlement rituals to allow users to spend crypto at retail speeds (<25s) without custodial risk.

### **How are you going to use BCH (Bitcoin Cash) in your project?**
> We use BCH as the final settlement layer. Specifically:
> 1. Utilizing **0-confirmation** for instant retail-speed payments.
> 2. Using **OP_RETURN** to log the cryptographic audit trail of the L2 attestation.
> 3. Using **CashScript covenants** to manage non-custodial solver liquidity.

### **Do you have plans to launch your own tokens or NFTs on Bitcoin Cash (CashTokens)?**
> **Yes.** We plan to use CashTokens for:
> 1. **Governance** of the Shadow Protocol Oracle network.
> 2. **Utility Incentives** for Liquidity Providers (Solvers) who rebalance the Solvency Loop.
> 3. **Merchant Loyalty NFTs** to integrate real-world discounts with on-chain payments.
